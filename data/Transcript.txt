 Initially the club Michael and then we'll just open with liberty and justice for all. So, let's get to the stage stand in for the first time. Let's go to the good ways. I'm going to be a better family. I think it's the first time we're here. It's not the first time. All right, so we're going to do the own office. And if somebody will do it together. So after we do the start and say your name, we'll just pause for starting to catch up for the next name. And if there's some close taken pose, the paper's not usually here, but they usually afterwards asked for the recording. Okay. So we just raise your leg and put it in the office. Do the office for the stand of the soda. So the company is a right in terms of everybody that we think. I think Andrew Lawrence Wheel is also a solidly swear or a firm that I will support that must be a institution that I need as a base. And the constitution of the state of Minnesota. And then I will do the start, hopefully the duties. I know this is a city. I'm right in the city of Clearwater. I'm right in the state of Minnesota. To the best of my introduction. I'd like to go to the studio. I'm going to go to the studio. I'm going to go to the studio. I'm going to go to the studio. I'm going to go to the studio. I'm going to go to the studio.

You've got to be sure we start with the approval of you. Some of your documents are used to everybody. And the other thing we can see are names that there's just a couple of people that you're working to say that are always here or our contractors. And so I thought to start with our engineers just to open with your introduction. Yeah. I've already just been asked and with bolted in May. So I've been city engineer personally here. Clear water for about at least three or four years. Well, it makes been your city engineer for more than that since 30,000. I'm happy to be working for you and get to know you better. We'll do the fire chief real quick. Like Caler, Ben's on business for 16 years. And also the fire department for 16 years. To cover this fire chief. It was one of the last year of 2022.

Kind of being great. I'm a law firm in Minneapolis. We are city attorney and the city attorney for Clearwater. We're going to the 20, 21. I'm sure we'll go to the firm and I represent the city's health. This city attorney and we specialize in municipal law. So that's what our firm does. Congratulations to the new council members. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. I'm a very, very, very, very, very, very. I'm looking for a motion to proceed agenda. Can you maybe I don't know who women is. Second. And then did that one to James tonight? Is there any discussion? Oh, and favor? I opposed extensions motion carries. Right, can I share with you more? I'm pretty new. I started in June, so I'm pretty new. I've been working on a bigger survey. Because I wanted to finish this last month, the graphics stops have been pretty normal. There's a lady who has been coming through and she's in the circumstance. She's been a very strong attorney and no good county. She's been stealing from cobras like her source. I'm a father today. So that's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. I'm going to raise the ocean clear water. It's a good town. I enjoy serving up here. January 17th. I'll be my last day up here. I'm looking along the cell. I won't make a cell. It's been a pleasure serving up here. Thanks for having me. Thank you. That's very important to just putting members in. We're trying to bring that to you. So I'm not going to make it as fancy. I'm going to make it as fancy. I'm going to make it as small as possible. So we're going to have to go. Opening up floor for people to form. It's already in public form. If you introduce yourself to the council, please. Yes. Hello. I'm Sarah Kalsen. We're going to have a number of times a fellow Avenue. I said one of the concerns over as I look over the agenda tonight. Concerns over to the committee. Not many things that were being. I was informed by the office that there were multiple applicants. Or the vacancies on a planning and parks commission. So I guess I'm all confused as to why one person received two of those. nominations in those spots. So I guess I would ask the city council tonight would maybe ask the mayor for an alternate in one of those positions. Anything else from the floor? Yes. Both in the look for them is Sarah motion to approve the consent agenda. So the moment is Sarah second. Second for Mr. Swingham again. Sarah, any discussion on consent agenda? On the favor. I suppose. Stentions. Oh, she carries. All business. Approved extension of rugby field at least agreement. This is on page 51 of your notice. And if you can need a concrepanied for right here to the place. But if I hear least agreement, the drug be. It's offer extension. But then they ask for a ten instead of a five this time. So so rise appropriately. I don't know exactly how long they've had a listen. They're the city but the last contract five this one was for five years. And so the rugby club and say, well, it asked for this extension and asked for it to be ten years at this time. I think it must be at least ten years because they were there before I joined her. It's not was eight years ago. So I would guess ten or 15 of them. No, no. They spend their renewal. So they're asking for ten. They usually do five. And you tell us that they pay. And if I was in the hours of the year for you said the fields that I'll draw a park. And they pay for both parties. And they pay for. Can't we just pay for two? Yeah, they added a handicap. Or so. Yeah, I know one of the, we are all the city doesn't go more money out there. Now, I've ever heard right. So we did. So we did. They've been over. Okay. So we don't have to pay for the board party. They've maintained two. And I think that's one of the same old party, which was used when we started doing those events. So some of that we didn't see what we did those events. But that we used it in the park and looked in the park. It was nice having. Bathroom's there especially with little kids. And then maybe a thousand dollars a year. So is there any thought and just something you want to make a motion to approve this? To take out a. I do that. It's a bunch of things. I can't remember. They do. I believe that doesn't. So those are our website owners. I'm not. They're excited. And they're also. And give us a schedule. So you're in a bottom to us a schedule. Can you have the idea in the contract. That's what I asked before. Growing that is basically. And scheduled should be. Kind of we do for the. The lover. Uh, the cameras. We do accept approval. And to share the promise. So we don't. And so. And continue to pass schedule. So. And you can always approve it. Condition. The term that they provide the city is. I don't know. They've been added. Then once I need to. For staff as I'm. Which everybody has it for the excited. It's. And then the. Is there a way to have a put on like the. The. The calendar. The city's website calendar. So people would be able to know. Look at the calendar. And see. Okay. They have there to be here on Saturday or. So much that. I'm not sure about the ability to. I mean, we would. We're. And this is on the difficulty right now. We're. The ball team and. Everybody. We simply rely on. It's. And everything. We just simply. Just. We try to do it. One. And. Hopefully. We have been a staff. Because that was part of that position was to manage the. So we have. And then. And then. Robby to you. You're. They're a face. I know they put trying to like, you know, a then here today, run me here today. So I think you could see at least water. And in the park. Not. We. I think they would give it to us. I mean, I think it's. It's more. And if we get that said, we can just scan it in post. And it was we could definitely. That one take any time. It's really. But man, we're going in every single. And we're. We're. We're. We. I just. I'll be. Kind of. I'll be like. We can just. Yeah. So like that. We're. Just. We're. So like that. We're. We're. We're. We're. We're. We're. We're. I don't know like can I move back to July. You kind of do. They have like river cats is there. The buildings right there for lines. It's just like. It's a lot of time to. To take. I've taken. I'm. I'm. You know, I'm. Concern. Schedulity. Okay. With our. Commence. Commence. Commence. Commence. Commence. Commence. Commence. Commence. As. At down pour. Saving. Unreal. It's. This. So the. And then approved annually. Quite a little bit. See 85. Super. I don't see. Milwaukee. Not good. I don't see. So. In my. H. I don't. schedule being given an approved vote, the council. Would you accept a friendly amendment to say the schedule is given to the council annually? And then we're moving to the group. Yes. Okay. And so there's a motion to approve the extension of the review release room for 10 years. The contingent that the schedule is provided annually. So, second, second, I remember a limited service session. Oh, my mayor. I got it. Close. Stentions. Motion carries. This isn't a period on the packet for the next one. And I'm going to give a meeting on a second to write down that motion. Because the next thing is for reporting. So we're going to give our minutes. Or is it? Because I just want to clarify some emotion was a resolution to approve the through the contract engine, and having an animal's schedule approved by the council, amended by Lawrence that they provided the schedule because it doesn't need a couple of the colleges provided. And then that would accept it. And then second, if I think that's correct. Correct. Correct. Right. Yes, the second is basically just an update that the council asked to have a monthly update on the site. So we've been working with Mr. Wright, Kelly, on COVID coursemen for several months. And it also wanted an update with Trump as progress has been made. And it really doesn't really want to update some classic months, really. It was then a year or several times or out of my second. But the status right now is a lot.
